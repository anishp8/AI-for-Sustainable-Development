# AI-for-Sustainable-Development
Coursework submissions for AI for Sustainable Development module

## Coursework 1
Critically analysing the 'Brick kiln classifcation' dataset from [Sustainbench](https://sustainlab-group.github.io/sustainbench/) and an associated AI model in the context of the [sustainable development goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) (SDGs).

## Coursework 2
Exploring the 'Out-of-Domain Land Cover Classification' dataset from [Sustainbench](https://sustainlab-group.github.io/sustainbench/) and developing an ML model to perform land cover classification of geogrpahic points across the World. In particular, I:

* Perfrom exploratory data analysis,
* Define an ML classification task to perform using this dataset and select an approproate evaluation criteria,
* Design and implement an ML classificaiton solution using a 1D Convolutional Neural Network,
* Perform perfromance and scalability analysis of my model,
* Outline my hypotheses for land cover classifcation and design a set of experiments to test the hypotheses,
* Perform the experiments and discuss the results, as well as the ethical implications,
* Discuss the relevance and impact to the [SDGs](https://sdgs.un.org/goals).
